<p><em>&#8220;Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.&#8221;</em></p>
&nbsp;<br />
<p>For our SCM workshop we will use Git. In the first set we&#8217;ll talk about initializing Git in your project. We&#8217;ll touch on some important core concepts before moving on to the advanced topics. You&#8217;ll learn about</p>

<ul>
<li>Cloning, Forking, Branching</li>
<li>Keywords like: Repository, Commits, and Pull-Requests</li>
<li>How to use online resource like <a href="http://www.github.com" title="GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://www.bitbucket.prg" title="BitBucket" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> to store/share your code</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setup</h3>
It&#8217;s important for you to have Git already working on your machine before the workshop. This way you can simply follow along. For Linux/Mac users, good news, it&#8217;s probably already installed! Launch a terminal and type
<pre>which git</pre>
<p> You should see something that looks like </p>
<pre>/usr/bin/git</pre>
			

<p> If you don&#8217;t, follow your OS&#8217;s specific instructions <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" title="Git Downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Windows users, sorry it&#8217;s not that easy. You can download the source from <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" title="Git Downloads" target="_blank">here</a> or try <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/" title="Git For Windows" target="_blank">Git for Windows</a>. Although I strongly encourage you to use Git in Powershell since our workshop will deal primarily in the command line. Here&#8217;s a link to help set that up: <a href="http://thepracticalsysadmin.com/setting-up-git-in-windows/" title="setting up git in windows powershell" target="_blank">Setting up Git in Windows Powershell</a></p>
